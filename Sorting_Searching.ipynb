While Python's built-in `sort()` and `sorted()` are highly optimized for general use cases (Timsort), understanding the underlying principles of algorithms like Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, and Quick Sort is crucial for theoretical knowledge, algorithm analysis, and specific performance requirements. Similarly, for searching, Linear Search is straightforward for unsorted data, but Binary Search offers significant speed advantages for sorted collections.\n",
