        "Welcome to this comprehensive guide on two of the most fundamental and widely used data structures in computer science: **Stacks** and **Queues**. Understanding these structures is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and solving a variety of programming problems. We'll cover their core principles, common operations, real-world applications, and provide practical Python implementations that you can run directly in Google Colab.\n",

        "A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. Imagine a stack of plates: you can only add a new plate to the top, and you can only remove the topmost plate. The last plate you put on is the first one you take off.\n",

        "  * **Linear Structure:** Elements are arranged sequentially.\n",
        "  * **Restricted Access:** Operations are limited to one end, typically called the \"top\" of the stack.\n",
